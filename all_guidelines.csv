1. Operational Dashboards

Operational dashboards monitor real-time data, track the end-to-end performance of various business operations, and communicate insights through clear data visualizations. These dashboards are designed to be used in daily workflows and provide time-sensitive insights and alerts about real-time developments. Operational dashboards are consistently updated to help with at-a-glance decision-making. The primary audience for these dashboards are managers and operational teams. Examples include

    Marketing Dashboards—Website performance metrics such as bounce rate, user lifetime value, average session time, etc.
    Software Development—System crash analytics, uptime monitoring, cloud service billing monitoring, etc. 

2. Strategic Dashboards

Strategic dashboards are mostly used by C-level executives, directors, or business owners to monitor long-term company OKRs and KPIs. They provide high-level updates on the performance of the overall organization or department. These dashboards update data less frequently than operational dashboards which are designed to be viewed daily. Strategic dashboards are complex in their creation because they need to accurately track organization-wide metrics that can be found in disparate data sources. Examples of such dashboards include

    Organization-wide—Tracking revenue and company OKRs at a glance.
    Department-wide—Tracking the marketing funnel from acquisition to purchase.

3. Analytical Dashboards

As the name implies, these dashboards are used to analyze and consume large amounts of complex data. Modern dashboarding tools provide consumers and practitioners with features like drill-down options, extensive filters, and the capability to handle large amounts of data. With analytical dashboards, one can go beyond glancing at metrics and investigate the drivers and dynamics behind the data itself.

With analytical dashboards, one can go beyond glancing at metrics and investigate the drivers and dynamics behind the data itself.

The primary audience for analytical dashboards is more technically-minded and can range from practitioners such as data scientists and analysts to managers looking to dig through insights. Examples of analytical dashboards include:

    Finance—Financial performance dashboards with the ability to break down revenue by channels, products, assets, and more
    Marketing—Google analytics dashboards providing high-level metrics and the ability to drill down to channels, referrals, traffic sources, and more",Anuj Syal,Best Practices for Designing Dashboards,2022,Datacamp,DuckDuckGo search,Blog post,No strong opinions (potential AI use),3,https://www.datacamp.com/blog/best-practices-for-designing-dashboards,"Use the grid layout feature: humans are naturally geared to look at things from left to right and top to bottom.

The most common types of dashboards are as follows:
1. Operational Dashboards

Operational dashboards monitor real-time data, track the end-to-end performance of various business operations, and communicate insights through clear data visualizations. These dashboards are designed to be used in daily workflows and provide time-sensitive insights and alerts about real-time developments. Operational dashboards are consistently updated to help with at-a-glance decision-making. The primary audience for these dashboards are managers and operational teams. Examples include

    Marketing Dashboards—Website performance metrics such as bounce rate, user lifetime value, average session time, etc.
    Software Development—System crash analytics, uptime monitoring, cloud service billing monitoring, etc. 

2. Strategic Dashboards

Strategic dashboards are mostly used by C-level executives, directors, or business owners to monitor long-term company OKRs and KPIs. They provide high-level updates on the performance of the overall organization or department. These dashboards update data less frequently than operational dashboards which are designed to be viewed daily. Strategic dashboards are complex in their creation because they need to accurately track organization-wide metrics that can be found in disparate data sources. Examples of such dashboards include

    Organization-wide—Tracking revenue and company OKRs at a glance.
    Department-wide—Tracking the marketing funnel from acquisition to purchase.
